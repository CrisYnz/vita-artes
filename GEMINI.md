# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project is a static, single-page website for "Fundación Vita Artes", an organization focused on education in Chile. The website is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and some JavaScript for interactive elements. It serves as a landing page to inform visitors about the foundation's mission, services, and how to get in touch.

## Building and Running

This is a static website. To view it, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. There are no build steps required.

## Development Conventions

The project uses standard HTML5 and JavaScript (ES6). Styling is done using Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the HTML. The JavaScript code is embedded within a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>`. It handles the mobile menu, an accordion component, and a simple page load animation.
